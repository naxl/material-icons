# material-icons
Material Icons for file association in Windows or Linux environment! 

Depending Upon what customization level you are on, If you are too much juss like me, then this repo is for you!, 

I have extracted these icons from several extensions and packages cross-platform, Just convert these icons to .ico files, the icons that you like, download them, and use this website https://cloudconvert.com/svg-to-ico to convert them  to .ico files. After converting the svgs to icos just customize them to the files or folders of your choice.

I have converted few icos to help you out with the hassle, check them out in converted folder.

(I do not own any rights/credits for any content, I have just extracted them to a well-organized material icon collection repo.! 
Pretty much all the packages are available on github and are open source, partly for the topic of credits, I myself have no idea what all packages i have used over time, Yes, they are collected over time, so pause for credibilty and forgive me to not take a note about timeline and credits [I will update if I come across any regarding thoughts])
